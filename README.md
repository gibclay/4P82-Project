# Rice Classification with GP
Rice serves globally as one of the most important staples of human food. The history of rice cultivation is long and as a result many different strands of rice have been cultivated that are now produced and consumed. Rice classification involves the categorization of distinct subgroups of rice by observing rice grains and their physical features. This assignment seeks to interpret a set of seven physical properties of rice to classify rice grains as one of two types of rice.
